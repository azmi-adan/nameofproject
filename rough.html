        <p class="paraclass"></p>>restore a deleted folder from a Git repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your repository's directory.
3. Use `git log` to find the commit before the deletion.
4. Copy the commit hash (a string of letters and numbers).
5. Use `git checkout <commit-hash> -- <folder-path>` to restore the folder.

Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash you copied and `<folder-path>` with the path to your deleted folder.

Remember, this will only work if the deletion was committed and you haven't pushed
 any changes that would overwrite the folder in your remote repository.</p>
